### How to run the RSpec test
You need to have the RSpec installed in you computer if you don't have it follow the steps.
Boot up your terminal and punch in gem install rspec to install RSpec. Once that‚Äôs done, you can verify your version of RSpec with rspec --version, which will output the current version of each of the packaged gems. Take a minute also to hit rspec --help and look through the various options available.

cd into the project and open a terminal.
